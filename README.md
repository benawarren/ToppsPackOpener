# ToppsPackOpener

This IOS app, written in Swift using XCode, allows the user to open any of 4 different Topps baseball card packs and "collect" virtual cards.
I was inspired in part by my own love of card-collecting and in part by the Topps Bunt app, which does something similar in the official realm. 
My idea was to take the idea of virtual card-collecting and make it more true to the physical Topps cards and packs themselves. Of course, I 
definitely do not have permission from Topps to use their materials, so this is just a passion project. 

Feel free to check out my other baseball card-collecting app: [Collector](https://github.com/s017274/Collector).
